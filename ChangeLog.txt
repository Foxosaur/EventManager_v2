Event Manager_v2
-----
This is the UI version of the Event Console but as a WPF project, in this, you can load Myth of Somas .evt files, edit them and save them back to Somas native format. This is designed to make it easier to manage a server as currently the tool is hand edited in notepad.

-Imported and adapted code from Event Console project for file load and parse of a .evt file into a custom list.
-Created datagrid and (finally) binded list to datagrid.
-Added functionality to edit rows and save the file back (to a hard coded save file named test.evt).
