Event Manager_v2
-----
This is the UI version of the Event Console but as a WPF project, in this, you can load Myth of Somas .evt files, edit them and save them back to Somas native format. This is designed to make it easier to manage a server as currently events are hand edited in notepad.

v0.01
-------
-Imported and adapted code from Event Console project for file load and parse of a .evt file into a custom list.
-Created datagrid and (finally) binded list to datagrid.
-Added functionality to edit rows and save the file back (to a hard coded save file named test.evt).

v0.02
-------
-Notes are now displayed and saved
-Now populating parameters (named as Values) of a line after loading a file (but it is erroring on null references...)
-Added a colored cell affect to event 'END' as a trial.

v0.03
-------
-Begun to implement combo selections.
-Removed dockpanels for now.

v0.04
-------
-Loading multiple EVTs in a session will empty the source list and refresh the datagrid.
-Added over half of the event functions (though not implemented)
-Event file loading will now remember the folder your using
-Added Help menu and a open glossary option - which reads an inbuilt text file of event help information. This opens in a new window


Bugs / Problems
-------
-If a parameter column isn't filled, it will error or similar but builds sucessful and works... needs to be dealt with later.
-Loading multiple evt files without closing and reopening causes a crash. (Fixed v0.04)
-Need to add remaining event functions (E done but A/O barely started).
-Need to re-size and ideally dock the new glossary window.


Outstanding features
-------

-Implement tool tips / help window.
-Implement load of NPC chat messages and ids from db.
